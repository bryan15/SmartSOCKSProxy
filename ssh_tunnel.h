// TODO: we should support connecting to a SOCKS5 proxy either not managed by this application, or in a remote host. Right now, it *must* be SSH running locally.
// example: 
//   - I want to use an interface different than 127.0.0.1 for the socks proxy Im connecting to
//   - I want to connect to some other host which is already running a socks5 proxy
// in other words, this file must be refactored from "ssh_tunnel" to <something else> which is a super-set
// of ssh_tunnel, direct, null, non-managed local socks proxy, and non-managed remote proxy.
